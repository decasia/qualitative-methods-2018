# Qualitative Methods 2018

This is a git repository with some teaching materials for a short graduate-level introduction to qualitative research. I taught it as a small seminar at Stellenbosch University in May 2018.

It was divided into two parts. All my students participated in the general section. A more advanced module for Social Anthropology students also took place.

## General Description

This module will introduce you briefly to the basics of qualitative research. We will cover qualitative interpretation, interviews and other forms of qualitative data gathering, and then will focus more specifically on two major forms of qualitative analysis: analysis of social strategies and of social spaces.

## Social Anthropology Section Description

This module will introduce you to some more advanced questions in ethnographically grounded fieldwork and analysis. We will start out by thinking about ethnographic field relationships, which are often complicated. We will then think about three major concepts in sociocultural analysis: ambivalence, ideology, and antagonism. These three concepts are closely connected. Ambivalence is one place to start thinking about the relationship between culture and subjectivity; ideology is the mechanism by which subjectivities are governed and produced; and antagonisms emerge when ideology isnâ€™t entirely successful at covering up the cracks in the social order.
