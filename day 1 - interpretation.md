# Culture

E.B. Tyler (1871): "Culture ... taken in its wide ethnographic sense is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabil- ities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."

Michael M.J. Fischer (2007): "Culture is (1) that relational (ca. 1848), (2) complex whole . . . (1870s), (3) whose parts cannot be changed without affecting other parts (ca. 1914), (4) mediated through powerful and power-laden symbolic forms (1930s), (5) whose multiplicities and per- formatively negotiated character (1960s), (6) is transformed by alternative positions, organizational forms, and leveraging of symbolic systems (1980s), (7) as well as by emergent new technosciences, media, and biotechnical relations (ca. 2005)."

# Ethnography & Gloria Anzaldúa

> What you or your cultures believe to be true is provisional and depends on a specific perspective. What your eyes, ears, and other physical senses perceive is not the whole picture but one determined by your core beliefs and prevailing societal assumptions. (542)

# Nepantla

*Nepantla* is an indigenous word for an in-between space, an intermediate place, a no-place place.

# Categories

> The binaries of colored/white, female/male, mind/body are collapsing. Living in nepantla, the overlapping space between different perceptions and belief systems, you are awware of the changeability of racial, gender, sexual, and other markings rendering the conventional labelings obsolete. Though these markings are outworn and inaccurate, those in power continue using them to single out and negate those who are "different"... (541)

# Seven stages of conocimiento

1. Safe terrain
2. Nepantla (which you enter by an earthquake)
3. The Coatlicue depths of despair 
4. A call to action
5. Making new patterns and stories about your reality
6. Testing your story in the world
7. "You shift realities... and find common ground" (545)

# Letting go of something

> You are no longer who you used to be. As you move from past presuppositions and frames of reference, letting go of former positions, you feel like an orphan, abandoned by all that's familiar. Exposed, naked, disoriented, wounded, uncertain, confused, and conflicted, you're forced to live en la orilla—a razor-sharp edge that fragments you. (547)

> The life you thought inevitable... is smoke, a mental construction, fabrication. (558)

# Culturalism/Risks of cultural analysis

- Seeing culture as fixed, ahistorical or primordial.
- Mapping cultures as isolated islands.
- Making culture into the single explanation of everything.
- Assuming that every individual just has one culture.
- Ignoring power and politics.
- Forgetting the active role of the interpreter.
