## Purpose

This module will introduce you briefly to the basics of qualitative research. We will cover qualitative interpretation, interviews and other forms of qualitative data gathering, and then will focus more specifically on two major forms of qualitative analysis: analysis of social strategies and of social spaces.

## Requirements

- Reading questions: For each class, you are required to submit *one question about each reading*, at least 30 minutes before class starts. (So if there are three readings, ask three questions!) For each day, send all your questions to me in a single email.
- Class attendance and participation, including in-class writing exercises.
- One short paper (1500-2000 words) discussing a social space and the strategies that go along with it, due May 25. This must be based on at least one successful interview that you conduct with someone.
