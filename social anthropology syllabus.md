## Purpose

This module will introduce you to some more advanced questions in ethnographically grounded fieldwork and analysis. We will start out by thinking about ethnographic field relationships, which are often complicated. We will then think about three major concepts in sociocultural analysis: ambivalence, ideology, and antagonism. These three concepts are closely connected. Ambivalence is one place to start thinking about the relationship between culture and subjectivity; ideology is the mechanism by which subjectivities are governed and produced; and antagonisms emerge when ideology isn’t entirely successful at covering up the cracks in the social order.

## Assignments

- Reading questions: For each class, you are required to submit *one question about each reading*, at least 30 minutes before class starts. (So if there are three readings, ask three questions!) For each day, send all your questions to me in a single email.
- Class attendance and participation, including in-class writing exercises.
- One short paper (1500-2000 words) analyzing a form of ambivalence and its relationship to an ideological discourse. This must be based on at least one successful interview and on field observations of your own (in a site of your choosing).
